# PageRank
  The progam calculates the page rank of various vertices using the formula described in:      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#Damping_factor
  Steps:
    1. counts the vertices and returns the value,
    2. initializes all the vertices to the same page rank (1/N where N is the number of vertices),
    3. loops through the vertices 30 times, calculating their page rank and
    4. prints the values out.
